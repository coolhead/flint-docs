##  Uncompress Flint

#### For UNIX/Linux

```bash
$ cd <file download directory>
$ unzip flint-x.x.x.x.zip
```

#### For Windows

Extract the files and folders from the zipped tarball into a directory of your choice.

Locate the compressed folder i.e flint-x.x.x.x.zip that you want to extract files and folders from. To extract the entire contents of the compressed folder, right-click the folder, click Extract All, and then follow the instructions.

>>>>> Compressed folder flint-x.x.x.x.zip is the downloaded Flint distribution version. For example : flint-0.1.0.0.zip

## Start Flint
After deployment of Flint build, we just need to kick-start it as below-

#### On UNIX/Linux
``` bash
$ cd flint-x.x.x.x
$ sh flint.sh start
```
>>>>> You can also **start Flint in a daemon mode**, to do so issue the following command: `sh flint.sh -d start`. To see list of available arguments run: `sh flint.sh`

#### On Windows
``` bash
cd flint-x.x.x.x
flint.bat start
```
>>>>> You can also install and start **Flint as Windows service**, to do so open an Administrator command prompt and issue the following command: `flint.bat installservice`. To see list of available arguments run: `flint.bat`

This will brings up the first worknode/instance of Flint Grid.
